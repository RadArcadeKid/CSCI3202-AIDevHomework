    "# CSCI 3202: Intro to AI - Fall 2020 Practicum 1\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "This practicum is due on Canvas by **11:59 PM on Monday November ~~2~~  10, apparently**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/MathJax directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are the rules:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. All work, code and analysis, must be your own. \n",
    "1. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbooks, in-class notebooks, and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions like the form of a probability distributions or how to perform a particular operation in Python/Pandas. \n",
    "1. This is meant to be like a coding portion of your midterm exam. So, the instructional team will be much less helpful than we typically are with homework. For example, we will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.  We will happily discuss ideas on your paper, however.\n",
    "1. If something is left open-ended, it is because we want to see how you approach the kinds of problems you will encounter in the wild, where it will not always be clear what sort of tests/methods should be applied. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",
    "2. You may **NOT** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "3. You may **NOT** copy-paste solutions *from anywhere*.\n",
    "4. You may **NOT** collaborate with classmates or anyone else.\n",
    "5. In short, **your work must be your own**. It really is that simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of the above rules will result in an immediate academic sanction (*at the very least*, you will receive a 0 on this practicum or an F in the course, depending on severity), and a trip to the Honor Code Council.\n",
    "\n",
    "**By submitting this assignment, you agree to abide by the rules given above.**\n",
    "\n",

    "**NOTES**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- You may not use late days on the practicums nor can you drop your practicum grades. \n",
    "- If you have a question for us, post it as a **PRIVATE** message on Piazza.  If we decide that the question is appropriate for the entire class, then we will add it to a Practicum clarifications thread. \n",
    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. The practicum is designed to be completed using only the packages in the first given code cell.\n",
    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API **do not** change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Canvas.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. \n",
    "- This should go without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit.\n",

    "In this exercise, we're going to be using simulated annealing to find solutions to the traveling salesman problem.Your two helper functions in part A should help!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we model a salesman that tries to \"reach\" each city on the graph to sell their wares.  As an algorithm, the goal of the traveling salesman problem is to find the path that:\n",
    "    - has the lowest total edge length (or path cost)\n",
    "    - hits each and every vertex/node exactly once\n",
    "    - the salesman may travel directly between *any* two cities (you will need more edges than you constructed in part A!)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use simulated annealing.  This means you need to come up with both a temperature function and a probability of acceptance function.  There is no guidance on these functions beyond:\n",
    "    - Given a path or solution to the problem, the temperature function proposes a new solution.\n",
    "    The new solutions should become more and more like the input solutions over time/as you run more iterations\n",
    "    - Given two solutions, the annealing algorithm will always accept one with a shorter path cost, and will have some probability that scales with temperature/iterations and becomes less and less likely to accept a new solution with longer path cost.\n",
    "    - All proposed solutions should pass through every node.\n",
    "    - There are many methods to \"adjust\" old solutions to propose new ones.  You should consider moving a single node to another location in the list, moving entire substrings to other locations, reversing the order of substrings, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "For any temperature/probability function pair, make sure you run annealing for sufficiently different initial conditions to generate a small sample of \"final solution lengths\" and \"number of iterations.\"\n",

    "**How this implementation works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, I generate an initial path with my `intial_path` function, and then pass that inital path into the simulated annealing algo. This inital path will have the possibility of exploring every node, and is garunteed to pass through each and every node exactly once, generally giving a path length somewhere around the range of 600-900 pathcost. Initially, I implemented this as a greedy algorithm, but I re-wrote it to correspond with what the write-up was supposed to be totally random, so as to ensure it generates sufficiently *different* inital conditions each time the algo is run\n",
    "- Then, I run through a for loop using a number of iterations\n",
    "- For each time the loop runs....\n",
    "    - I get the current <span style=\"color:red\">temperature</span>, based on one of the two following schedule functions:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - **ONE** these temperature functions I used (`schedule`) was: $$T(t) = \\dfrac{C}{(t+1)^p}$$, keeping $C$ at around 70 degrees and $p$ at 0.7. This function was originally given to us in class, however, I have modified the default values here that produce a more consistent end result. I used this simply because it seemed like a fitting temperature function that was effective. \n",
    "        \n",
    "        - The **ALTERNATE** temperature function (`schedule_alt`) was similar, it was based on an implemenation from mathworks.com (full URL below): $$T(t) = \\dfrac{C}{(t+1)}$$. I chose this because I wanted to attempt a different decrease of temp to see if $p$ would affect the final results. I kept the C at around 90 degrees since it seemed to produce the best results on average \n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Once I have current temp, I then generate a new permuation of a possible solution, using the `generate_new_path` function\n",
    "        - This function will take in the current path, copy it\n",
    "        - It will then generate two random numbers (within the range of the list; one is within range of the first half, the other within the second half)\n",
    "        - It will create a new path based on the reversed substring of the current path determined by these two random numbers. These can be anywere from reversing two cities to the entire list\n",
    "        - Depending on the value of temperature this will happen more/less times via a for loop, **such that the magnitude of the changes proposed is dependant on temperature** (i.e., there won't be *massive* changes to the list at lower temperatures, where high temperatures will keep iterating the above process a lot, generating a list with more entropy)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Once a new path is determined, the function will calculate a pathcost of both the current path and the new proposed path, and determine a delta change in past cost from the newly proposed solution (current - new) \n",
    "        - If the proposed path has a smaller path cost than the current, the algorithm will choose the proposed path; updating the new least-costly value \n",
    "        \n",
    "        - Otherwise, it will determine whether to select this probability based on one of the two <span style=\"color:orange\">$P(acceptance)$</span> equations: \n",
    "            - **ONE** of the two probability functions `p_accept_f` is similar to the one we used in class: $$p_{accept} = \\exp{\\left(\\dfrac{\\Delta E}{T(t)}\\right)}$$, which uses an exponinent of e and generally appears to be one of the most commonly-used p(acceptance) functions out there. I attempted to shift/adjust current temperature value by adding/subtracting to no avail \n",
    "            - The **ALTERNATE** of the two probability functions is `p_accept_f_alt`, like the second temp function, sourced from Mathworks.com: $$p_{accept} = \\dfrac{0.2}{1 + \\exp{\\left(\\dfrac{\\Delta E}{T(t)}\\right)}}$$ I changed the numerator 0.1 from the original function's (which was 1) because after initally running it I noticed that the function would start accepting really crappy results, and overall produce a mediocre solution \n"

    "**AI-Generated Fake News and the Dilemma of Misinformation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the ever-expanding world of the internet and social media, perhaps one of the things that we encounter most often is false information - more specifically, fake news, false information, or over-exaggerated points from media outlets which are intended to evoke emotion instead of informing the reader. This type of content can be found whether the information is spread maliciously or unintentionally due to the easily-accessible nature of posting on social media sites. Regardless of the intention, and due to both the sheer volume of content and amount of unreliable news stories, disinformation can spread incredibly rapidly and gain traction and following as a result of the ease of sharing. This presents a serious problem when combined with the potential of AI-generated content and news. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   Because of the way that human speech patterns are incredibly repetitive and quantifiable, specifically in writing, AI is able to mimic human writing patterns to a tee, and produce information as a result of language combinatory logic and massive amounts of data. A case study which was presented in New York Times illustrates a fantastic case study of the consequences of this - a company known as OpenAI has created an AI which generates news articles based on data that it is fed, mimicking English writing patterns and utilizing nonfiction events to generate artificial news content which is eerily similar to human writing. In fact, the content is so well produced that the authors of the article actually point out having trouble telling the real human writing from the AI writing in some cases. The authors show how when given a prompt to write about US political parties, for example, the content of the article dynamically changes depending upon the commonly held viewpoints of each party \\[1\\]. As it stands - these types of advanced content-generation programs are exclusively reserved for researchers and the companies that developed them, and are not being released to the general public. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "Why does choice to release or not release this technology present an ethical dilemma? The authors of this article first point out that this presents a dangerous way for misinformation to be spread, especially on a wide scale. When this is in the hands of researchers or academics, it is less of an issue and more of an area of study about content generation, but if such a technology becomes open-source and available to the general public, this is where the problem begins to unfold. The NYT article points out if these tools are utilized by bad actors, content-generation en masse can actually be a powerful tool for spreading propaganda and disinformation harming the public as a result. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, others have argued that such content generation isn’t inherently flawed. An article from The Verge points out that when moderated, such content being made available to the public can be a powerful tool for researchers \\[2\\], and the fear that it could be used negatively can perhaps be overstated  due to current limitations with the technology. For one thing, they point out that OpenAI’s generated articles aren’t flawless, and moreover, can never replace previously credibly-established news organizations. Moreover, for uses like entertainment media, this can actually have huge advantages, as no-name sites and companies seeking to make traffic-driven ad-revenue are able to profit for actually very little work when utilizing similar algorithms to generate articles regardless of content, as one CNBC author notes \\[4\\]. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways to examine this dilemma on a more abstract level is outlined in an UCS article on ethical studies \\[3\\]. Through the use of an ethical framework known as utilitarianism, the idea that ‘utility’ or overall ‘goodness’ ought to be maximized, reducing the amount of harm in the world. In the case, the question becomes - are the research opportunities and potential gains from releasing this technology worth releasing AI programs which can generate this type of content rapidly? An issue that can be raised with this is that the amount of overall harm done via the proliferation of fake articles and AI generated content being shared and spread by social media may, in fact, far outweigh the simple research opportunities and value gained from releasing such technology as open-source and giving access to the public. However, dissenters may argue that begs the question whether such AI generated fake-news could hypothetically be prolific enough to spread disinformation, i.e., would the net harm done actually be as prolific as some researchers are concerned about? If the technology isn’t perfect, and is only used within the sphere of less-consequential entertainment media for example, why worry? For this, one can argue, when combined with something like a botnet, for example, it can be used by people en masse to ostensibly drown out real information and news stories reaching social media before other companies report on issues. It can cloud the facts of a story with similar-sounding or similarly written but not objectively true content. This presents the issue of decreasing overall net-utility as a result of the technology being released. \n",
    "\n",
    "When arguing the question of rights, whether people have a right to this fake-news AI, perhaps this is less suited for the scope of this paper, suffice to say that the question whether people have a right to AI driven-content is perhaps hard to fully answer without asking questions about the ownership of scientific discoveries and intellectual property. \n",
    "The “common good” lens can also be used here, such that, is there a common-good for the public to be able to generate AI fake news? It is difficult to say, especially considering the fact that corporations can absolutely monetize this with traffic-based revenue, while the overall common good from simply reading this AI-created news may not actually be worth it. Of course, this all depends on the accuracy, intention, and methods by which this AI is used. AI generated news, if used as a tool for research, could actually benefit those seeking to combat fake news and identify methods by which AI-driven content could be classified, increasing the common-good to most peoples’ lives, such that they could ironically see less fake news. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This, in turn, leads us to view this dilemma through the lens of virtue \\[3\\] - when presented with the opportunity for massive amounts of AI driven content, will this be used for morally virtuous pursuits? Perhaps, one can argue, the proliferation of AI driven content with fake news can be used to drown out propaganda, or even used to quickly produce legitimate information when combined with factually-verified data to generate content. Again, citing the example previously, this technology could be utilized by researchers to combat fake news. On the other hand, we must ask ourselves whether such pursuits will, in fact, be followed by the general public and corporations valuing a profit, further abstracting the problem to whether people will act virtuously when presented with such powerful tools of content generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   Regardless of the ethical framework though, there are several consequences which fall from both the action of continuing to generate such fake news and release the methods to do so to the general public. Even if researchers were able to identify the fake news now, with foreseeable improvements of the technology in the future, that line begins to blur. What then are they to do? Furthermore, when this technology is combined with botnets, massive media conglomerates, and the ever-expanding world of social media, it raises concerns about the legitimacy of information and being able to quickly verify and fact-check this news, which is already a growing problem. \n",
    "To conclude, this type of technology can be perhaps ethically positive, in the sense that it can be monetizing non-essential news media like entertainment and combating fake news, however the potential for misinformation of truly important stories, political news, or bad actors to take over the content, or to simply flood the market with misinformation, regardless of intent, is simply too great. It doesn’t benefit the common good, nor does it guarantee people will act in a virtuous way if this AI is able to be used by everyone. In an already over-saturated world of media content spread via social media, we need to ask ourselves whether utilizing AI to generate fake news articles is the most ethical thing to do. With the sheer volume of content able to be produced at any given moment means that given a proper outlet, such articles can spread to an absolutely absurd amount of people over such an amount of time, creating a veritable ocean of content which is impossible to keep up with and fact-check every detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As it stands, I would wholeheartedly fall within the argument that releasing this AI-content-generation tool to the general public is dangerous, due to the amount of potential utilitarian harm, the lack of common-good, and the questionable virtuousness of individuals who have this technology. The technology is still too much in its infancy phase, and combined with social media and the potentiality for bad actors to use this, presents a dangerous future where we can no longer tell the difference between real and fake news. \n"
